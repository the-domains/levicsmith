# Take Time To Write It Down

Basic emotional need in my life: Number 1\. I gotta process.

I have discovered in the last year, I have a lot going on between my ears. Too much sometimes. 

When I was 12 I loved water balloons. I had a problem tho. I thought, the bigger the water balloon: the better.. I would fill the water balloon up until it was way over filled. Like so full you gotta hold it with two hands and it's still scary. You carry those things like they are active bombs, cause one wrong move and boom, you're the one wearing the water. In actuality, you render the water balloon useless because you no longer have the ability to throw it. The balloon is too week to handle the force needed to propel it toward your victim. 

Over the last year, My brain has felt like an over filled water balloon. At many points it was rendered completely useless because the amount of unprocessed information I was putting into it. Focusing on too many things is as dangerous as not having a focus at all. 

At any given moment, I have lots of different things flying through my brain. A close friend described this kind of struggle as a money hurricane machine, only it's filled with my thoughts. You know those gimmicks at auto dealerships or TV shows where a lucky person can go into a hurricane machine that has money flying around inside. The goal is to grab as much of it as possible. Processing information in my brain becomes important when I have so much flying through it, I don't know what is important and what isn't, so I just start grabbing. It's not productive, efficient or healthy in any way. 

I need to pick out the important stuff. Not just grabbing the first three things that wiz past my face and land magically in my hand. I believe the trick will be choosing things that are not just things I like. But, picking the best things. Tacos are a good thing, but if I eat tacos everyday I might start having some problems. Just like you need a healthy diet, you need a healthy mix of priorities.

What are my top priorities? not just want I want them to be... (Although, that is helpful at this point). But, what are they actually? Where am I really spending my time? 

I need to process the many different feelings, problems, emotions, etc. etc. etc. Or else I waffle, don't actually rest, and end up frustrated. I want to process to make progress. 

New priority number one is taking time to write it down. For me, writing is the best way to process and take a lot of crazy and make it concrete.
