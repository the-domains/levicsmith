# My Son. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/146503c0-4c7f-4a4a-bfbf-6e182127f428.jpg)

Having late December feel like early April is really spoiling us here in VT. Finn and I went out and played on the play ground today. (I fell in love with my camera again). Inspired by some Instagram photographers I have recently followed from the west coast. Thanks @owlthelight and others for looking at cool things.
