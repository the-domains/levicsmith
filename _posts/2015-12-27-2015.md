Can you write a neat synopsis of a year in your life? I can't. As hard as I try, I can not fit this last year in to a single neat blog post. Too much has happened.  

- Great family adventures. 

- Trying my hand at leading a new ministry strategy. 

- Learning to read. (still).

- Building some great friendships. 

- Learning to see my inconsistency and doing something about it. 

I honestly can't even try to tell you, even just the super important things. If you really gotta know, just creep my [instagram][0].

I've learned some life changing lessons this year. I'm still processing most of them. Working out how these things will _really_ influence my life. But, that is just it. These lessons _will_ influence my life. That is why I am starting LEVICSMITH.COM

This is a website with the focus of giving me an outlet to process, prose, and publish my thoughts. The first few weeks of this 4-OnGoing project are going to be key to the rest of my life. I have discovered, or maybe more accurately, God has been showing me that, in my life, some things are a bit more important than others. What's more is that I have completely missed these few (extremely crucial) things for the last bit, and I feel foolish for it. 

You're probably dying to know more. Here are the bullet points. 

1\. Take time to write it down.

2\.  Start every day with Jesus.

3\. Love People. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/50e56f4e-f16f-4d78-9789-eb6f487d218e.JPG)
