Can you write a neat synopsis of a year in your life? I can't. As hard as I try, I can not fit this last year in to a single neat blog post. Too much has happened.  

- Great family adventures. 

- Trying my hand at leading a new ministry strategy. 

- Learning to read. (still).

- Building some great friendships. 

- Learning to see my inconsistency and doing something about it. 

I honestly can't even try to tell you, even just the super important things. If you really gotta know, just creep my [instagram][0].

I've learned some life changing lessons this year. I'm still processing most of them. Working out how these things will _really_ influence my life. But, I hope that is just it. These lessons _will_ influence my life. That is why I am starting LEVICSMITH.COM... 

This is a website with the focus of giving me an outlet to process, prose, and publish my thoughts. The first few weeks of this 5-OnGoing project are going to be key to the rest of my life. God has been showing me some big things that I need to keep as big things in my life. The first one is taking time to write things down... but I am getting ahead of myself. 

levicsmith.com is (at the moment) about a three things I want to do more of, to better myself. 

* I'm seeking to write more. Not to be a writer, but to develop my voice as a person. 
* I'm seeking to create more. Not to be an artist, but to express what is in my heart.

I'm seeking to be more authentic Not to bombard you with my thoughts, but to give you a glimpse of who I really am. 

So, now you know why I'm here... Why are you? (Drops mic).  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/50e56f4e-f16f-4d78-9789-eb6f487d218e.JPG)
